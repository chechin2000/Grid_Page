					I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if

					"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcampo. I've been lookin to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

					'Before joining the bootcamp, rye never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and !never had to walt long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, rve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple off ers.100% recommend! -

The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
